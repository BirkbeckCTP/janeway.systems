						<h1>Testimonials</h1>
						<p class="lead">We love what we do - and we're sure you will too. But don't just take our word for it - see these testimonials from other organisations that we've provided hosting services for.</p>

						  <p>When managing the University of Huddersfield Press I was responsible for finding a new platform to publish and disseminate our journal and book content. After extensive market research, I decided upon Janeway. We were the first press to sign with Janeway, and we did so for several reasons. Their platform was the most intuitive one I had seen in terms of user experience, and it was the only platform to offer all of the integration, analytical and dissemination features which we were keen to have. The team behind Janeway were a pleasure to work with, and in addition to being helpful and informative, they were very open to working collaboratively on the platform, which makes a big difference.</p>

						  	<p>The Janeway hosting platform is fast proving to be an immensely valuable asset in terms of showcasing research and scholarship at the University of West London where our institutional aim has been to grow our research culture beyond the academy and embed the message of the Budapest Open Access Initiative. By migrating to Janeway, our university press content is finally curated and indexed at a level that we are truly proud of as well as fully open access.</p>

							<p>The Open Library of Humanities are also brilliant partners and Andy and the team really helped us to understand the full suite of services and were extremely quick to respond to our queries which in turn provided a very quick turn around time for implementation.</p>

						  <p>IDPro is a professional organization for identity and access management (IAM) practitioners. Part of our mission is to create an IAM Body of Knowledge, developed by and for IAM practitioners, to help normalize information in the industry. Building a Body of Knowledge requires a unique interaction between authors and reviewers, and needs a simple but professional editorial approach for the publication process that can be suited towards a small, focused organization like IDPro. We are not at all like a traditional publication house, though many of our requirements are the same. Janeway provides the simple and flexible approach for review and publication that we need, and their support as we design processes that work for us has been greatly appreciated.</p>
